I'm trying to make website using **MERN** as my senior project. It's been roughly a year since I started learning web development from the beginning. The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, The Net Ninja and Traversy Media, all of them have been a really helpful in this journey.

Right now It's a dynamic website with just React uses Routers. In the future I'm going work with JSON data to show information on the website and maybe implement admin authentication and CRUD operations. Who knows.

I started to make this as a static website but as part of my senior project I decided to switch to MERN stack dynamic website. I almost know nothing about MERN but I know enough about JavaScript. I got into some tutorials on Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB and ReactJS. I roughly 8-9 months to finish I almost know nothing. So wish me luck!
