## The Websites I've tried to create

Here's some of my website designs that I've made as a beginner. Thanks for checking out.

### <a href="https://codepen.io/realsarius/pen/dyRGbwY" target="_blank">To-Do List</a>

This is a little web page I've tried to create with the help of a tutorial. I've changed the design a bit. This task list uses local storage to save tasks.

### <a href="https://codepen.io/realsarius/pen/poyQNNZ" target="_blank">Tribute Page</a>

I'm honored to show you my first website design that I've created. I've used a little bit of basic CSS.

### <a href="https://codepen.io/realsarius/pen/MWyzpap" target="_blank">A Dumb Survey Form</a>

This one is my favorite. I've used **synthwave**'s color palette.

### <a href="https://codepen.io/realsarius/pen/MWyZVbd" target="_blank">Scuffed Google Clone</a>

**Scuffed Google Clone**. I'm not German nor I was in Germany, but the Google page was in German. Don't ask!
