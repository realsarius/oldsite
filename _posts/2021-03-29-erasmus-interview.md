[Erasmus+ Progrmame](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/about_en) is an exchange program where university students can study in one of the 37 countries. It's a great opportunity, not only for the education, but to meet people from different cultures and backgrounds, learn the beautiful country you'll be studying at, and many more. For my scuffed clone website I've decided to not be so lazy and post some common interview questions that is possible for interviewer to ask to interviewee.

### Questions

1. Introduce yourself, tell about your family
2. Why do you want to go to Erasmus, tell me.
3. Why did you choose X countries?
4. What do you know about country X?
5. Who Will Fund You?
6. The country you want to live in
7. What do you think about the book and magazine reading rate in Turkey?
8. You lost your passport abroad, what do you do?
9. What will you do after completing Chapter 9?
10. What would you like to do if you had a lot of money?

That's all for now! :)
