Serotonin impacts every part of your body, from your emotions to your motor skills. Serotonin is considered a natural mood stabilizer. Itâ€™s the chemical that helps with sleeping, eating, and digesting. Serotonin also helps:

    reduce depression
    regulate anxiety
    heal wounds
    stimulate nausea
    maintain bone health


Serotonin helps regulate your mood naturally. When your serotonin levels are normal, you feel:

    happier
    calmer
    more focused
    less anxious
    more emotionally stable

A 2007 study found that people with depression often have low levels of serotonin. Serotonin deficiency has also been linked to anxiety and insomnia.

Minor disagreements about the role serotonin plays in mental health have occurred. Some researchers in older studies have questioned whether an increase or decrease in serotonin can affect depression. Newer research claims it does. For example, a 2016 animal study examined mice lacking serotonin autoreceptors that inhibited serotonin secretion. Without these autoreceptors, the mice had higher levels of serotonin available in their brains. Researchers found these mice exhibited less anxiety and depression-related behaviors.
